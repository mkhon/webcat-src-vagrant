Some notes on compiling Web-CAT with the recent Project Wonder:

1) Bootstrap is modified: WCServletAdaptor now derives from ERXServletAdaptor
so that ERXApplication.setup() is called during servlet initialization.

This removes the requirement to use hacked JavaWOJSPServlet_client.jar:
the version shipped with officially distributed web-cat .wars is different
from stock WebObjects version - it has a patch to call ERXApplication.setup()
during init().

There is a minor hack in WCServletAdaptor - URLs are added to the existing
classloader using reflection.

2) There is one more thing left - WebCAT developers kept their fixes for
Project Wonder in EOJDBCPrototypes.jar (it is loaded before everything else):
there are some changed project Wonder classes there but they do not match
the latest project Wonder API so they can not be used. These changed classes
have some fixes - they may or may not be required with the latest Project Wonder.

Unfortunately WebCAT developers did not track Project Wonder versions so it is
rather hard to extract their fixes from their patched project Wonder classes.
But this can be done later.

In the mean time all the patched Project Wonder classes are excluded from the build.
